This is a library to do CPS transformation on a delimited area of
Common Lisp code. A interpreted serializable continuation part of the
codebase is based on code that was originally written by Marco
Baringer in his Arnesi library. With his permission it was factored
out into this library and further developed by Attila Lendvai. Please
consult the repo history for more details about the credits.
